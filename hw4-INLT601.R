#the intercept is significant given that even without the effects of independent variables, 
#its highly possible there are other factors which explain vote turnout

#inflation * ideology: this represents both the main effects of inflation and ideology, as well as their interaction term. 
#It tries to capture how the effect of inflation on voter turnout changes with 
#varying levels of ideological self-placement.
#in this case, deviance of residuals are the minimum and maximum values are -2.9627 and 1.7144 respectively,
#which could be indicative of model fit.
#our model model explains a considerable amount of variability in voter turnout.
#several predictors are highly significant, although unemployment and ideology do not seem to interact in affecting voter turnout.
#we may want to look into the missing data and run additional diagnostics to validate the model's assumptions and fit.

#which is especially helpful if you think that there are unobserved factors that influence voter turnout 
#and are connected with our independent variables.

#null model benchmarking: Assess the added value of predictors over a null model.
#categorical variables: Include dummies for categories like gender and socio-economic status.
#model selection: Employ a random effects model, justified via a Hausman test.
#alternative economic indicators: Test models using inflation and GDP growth as additional explanatory variables.
